            <h2> ✧ Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>To ensure safe and efficient pharmaceutical service delivery, we may request you to provide specific
                personally identifiable information. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address,
                phone number, delivery address, and medical prescription details. The information we collect is used
                to process medication orders, verify prescriptions, communicate health information, and update you

            <p>We may also collect data related to your purchase history and browsing preferences to provide more
                personalized experiences. For example, this may include recommending over-the-counter wellness
                products that complement your prescriptions or offering reminders for medication refills.
                MediTrust is committed to ensuring this data is handled with the utmost confidentiality and
                only used to improve your health management experience.</p>
