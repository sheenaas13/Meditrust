            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                At MediTrust Pharmacy, we aim to provide every customer with safe, high-quality pharmaceutical
                and healthcare products. Our Return & Refund Policy outlines the rights, obligations, and procedures
                for returning or requesting refunds on purchases made through our website or retail outlets.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that certain situations may arise where a product is damaged, expired, or not what you
                expected. To make this process as fair and transparent as possible, our policy clearly defines how
                returns, refunds, and replacements are handled to maintain both customer satisfaction and regulatory
                compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase. By shopping with MediTrust, you acknowledge
                that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms mentioned herein.
            </p>

        <section id="returnpolicy-conditions" class="returnpolicy-section">
            <h2>Return Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                Only products that are unused, unopened, and in their original packaging can be returned. This includes
                maintaining the original labels, seals, and barcodes. Items must be returned within 7 days of delivery
                along with the original invoice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Products that have been opened, used, or tampered with cannot be accepted due to safety and hygiene
                regulations, especially for prescription medicines, personal care products, and temperature-sensitive
                items like insulin or vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
                MediTrust reserves the right to reject a return request if the product appears used or damaged after
                delivery. Our team may request supporting photos or videos for verification before approving a return.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="returnpolicy-refunds" class="returnpolicy-section">
            <h2>Refund Process</h2>
            <p>
                Once your return is received and inspected, MediTrust will notify you via email or SMS regarding the
                approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be processed automatically to your
                original payment method within 7â€“10 business days.
            </p>
            <p>
                For prepaid orders, the amount will be refunded directly to your bank account or wallet. For Cash on
                Delivery orders, refunds will be issued via bank transfer or UPI after collecting bank details from the
                customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event that MediTrust initiates a refund due to an operational issue (such as product
                unavailability
                or shipment delays), you will be notified and refunded immediately without requiring a return request.
            </p>

        <section id="returnpolicy-cancellations" class="returnpolicy-section">
            <h2>Order Cancellations</h2>
            <p>
                Orders can be canceled before they are dispatched. Once the order is shipped, cancellation requests
                will not be accepted. However, you can still initiate a return after receiving the product if it meets
                our eligibility criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                MediTrust reserves the right to cancel any order due to unavailability of stock, payment issues,
                prescription verification failure, or incorrect information provided during checkout. Customers will
                be notified of cancellations and eligible refunds will be processed promptly.
            </p>
            <p>
                For subscription-based medicine deliveries, you may cancel the upcoming cycle anytime before the
                dispatch
                date. Refunds for prepaid subscription orders will be handled in accordance with the refund process
                above.
            </p>

        <section class="returnpolicy-section">
            <h2>Non-returnable Items</h2>
            <p>
                Certain items are not eligible for return or refund due to health, safety, or regulatory restrictions.
                These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opened or used medicines, even if partially consumed.</li>
                <li>Temperature-sensitive products such as insulin, vaccines, and biologicals.</li>
                <li>Personal care products like creams, lotions, or hygiene items once unsealed.</li>
                <li>Customized compounded medicines or prescriptions filled on request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We encourage customers to review the product description carefully and consult our pharmacists before
                placing an order for any specialized or non-returnable products.
